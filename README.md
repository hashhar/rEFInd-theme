## Minimalistic rEFInd theme

## ARCHIVAL NOTICE: I no longer use rEFInd (even though I've never seen anything more prettier) and just use the default EFI bootloader in my laptop firmware instead and will hence be no longer maintaining this. Please feel free to fork if needed.

[rEFInd](http://www.rodsbooks.com/refind/) is a simplistic boot manager for UEFI
based systems. This is a clean and minimal theme (dark variant) for it forked from [EvanPurkhiser's theme](https://github.com/EvanPurkhiser/rEFInd-minimal).

### Usage

 1. Locate your refind EFI directory. This is commonly `/boot/EFI/refind`
    though it will depend on where you mount your ESP and where rEFInd is
    installed. `fdisk -l` and `mount` may help.

 2. Create a folder called `themes` inside it, if it doesn't already exist

 3. Clone this repository into the `themes` directory.

 4. To enable the theme add `include themes/rEFInd-theme/theme.conf` at the end of
    `refind.conf`. For the dark theme, use `include themes/rEFInd-theme/theme_dark.conf`.

Here's an example menuentry configuration (from the screenshot)

```nginx
menuentry "Windows 10" {
	icon /EFI/refind/themes/rEFInd-theme/icons/os_win.png
	loader /EFI/Microsoft/Boot/bootmgfw.efi
}

menuentry "Ubuntu GNOME 16.04.1 LTS" {
	icon /EFI/refind/themes/rEFInd-theme/icons/os_ubuntugnome.png
	volume "2ea3ea21-dec5-4bb4-a1a9-e7d3a857904c"
	loader /vmlinuz.efi.signed
	initrd /initrd.img
	options "root=PARTUUID=2ea3ea21-dec5-4bb4-a1a9-e7d3a857904c ro quiet splash"
	submenuentry "older kernel" {
		volume "2ea3ea21-dec5-4bb4-a1a9-e7d3a857904c"
		loader /vmlinuz.old.efi.signed
		initrd /initrd.img.old
	}
	submenuentry "GRUB" {
		volume "c95d1e6c-339c-4dd4-b08d-9067e783cbb0"
		loader /EFI/ubuntu/grubx64.efi
		initrd
		options
	}
	submenuentry "to single user mode" {
		volume "2ea3ea21-dec5-4bb4-a1a9-e7d3a857904c"
		loader /vmlinuz.efi.signed
		initrd /initrd.img
		options "root=PARTUUID=2ea3ea21-dec5-4bb4-a1a9-e7d3a857904c ro quiet splash single"
	}
	submenuentry "to recovery mode" {
		volume "2ea3ea21-dec5-4bb4-a1a9-e7d3a857904c"
		loader /vmlinuz.efi.signed
		initrd /initrd.img
		options "root=PARTUUID=2ea3ea21-dec5-4bb4-a1a9-e7d3a857904c rw recovery nomodeset"
	}
}
```

Entries that are autodetected should also show the proper icons.

### Background sizes

If you find the background looks blurry it may be due to the included wallpaper
being an incorrect resolution for your monitor. You can download the [original
high quality wallpaper][wallpaper], resize it as appropriate, and replace the
`background.png`.

You can of course also choose your own background!
